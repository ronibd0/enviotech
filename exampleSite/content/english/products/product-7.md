  100 - 610, Waste Water Set-Ups. Precise Water Analysis in High-Quality Design. The
  MD 100 photometer is a convenient choice for testing up to 14 parameters on a single
  instrument. All MD 110 photometers have a Bluetooth® function. To make the most
  of it, Tintometer offers an app for mobile devices as well as a PC software with
  dongle. The measurement results are transmitted to external devices via the Bluetooth®
  interface for quick evaluation and processing so that all data can be evaluated
  and assigned directly on site. MD 200 combines high-quality interference filters
  with long-term stable LEDs as light sources in a high-precision optic. The result:
  precise measurement results at all times - no matter where you use it. MD 600 multi-parameter
  photometer is pre-programmed with over 120 water testing parameters and ranges.
  Featuring a rugged, waterproof design, this instrument is the ideal testing solution
  for a variety of applications and industries. The MultiDirect - a contemporary,

* The Lovibond® COD Setups allow highly sensitive and precise water testing with minimum effort. They measure the ST-COD concentration by photometric detection employing a linear relationship between absorbance and concentration. After adding the sample to a Lovibond® COD tube test (LR, MR according to ISO 15705:2002), it is heated in the reactor for two hours at 150 °C and then analysed in the photometer. The COD Setups comprise the photometer, 25 tube tests for each of the two lower measuring ranges, a reactor for sample digestion and a vial stand.
