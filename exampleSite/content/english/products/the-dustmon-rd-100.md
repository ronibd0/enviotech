description = "The DustMon RD 100 was designed to reliably determine the dustiness of granular products and powders.  The Dust Analyzer DustMon RD 100 characterizes the dustiness of powders and granulates and is an ideal system to measure the amount and concentration of dust. The analysis method offers a real-time measurement with up to 1000 measurements per second. All results will be stored and can be transferred into other databases such as Excel."

* Ability to set up and configure the DustMon RD 100 for various applications including more advanced settings for Research and Development
* Graphic display of measurements with the possibility to overlay historical data to analyze and compare
* Average values are provided

Displayed results

* Maximum dust concentration in % (0-100 % of complete dust concentration)
* Dust concentration after 30 seconds
* Dust index (= maximum value + value after 30 seconds)

**DUST ANALYZER DUSTMON RD 100FUNCTION PRINCIPLE**

RETSCHâ€™s DustMon RD 100 consists of a dosing control system (sample beaker \[1\] with a valve and a tube \[2\], which is easily detachable for cleaning and transportation, a sample collector \[3\], a light source \[4\] and a detector \[5\].  
  
The sample is poured into the sample beaker \[1\]. On starting the measurement, the valve opens and the sample drops down the tube \[2\] into the sample collector \[3\].  
  
The dust generated in the sample collector will be measured by the detector \[5\] and the resulting dust index will be displayed.  
  
Results:

* Maximum dust concentration in % (0-100 % of complete dust concentration)
* Dust concentration, dust index (maximum and concentration) and dust area available after 30 seconds
