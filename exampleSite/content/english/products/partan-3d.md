FEATURES

* By having the ability to measure 40 parameters including 15 size, 13 shape / form, 3 surface roughness, density, transparency, and 3D in one analysis, the PARTAN 3D provides users with superior analysis capability that enables quick and confident decision-making regarding product quality
* Industry leading size range provides the user with greater analysis flexibility to measure a variety of materials
* The high-speed, high-resolution camera ensures multiple, vivid pictures of your material are collected which result in accurate analysis
* Engineered to be able to handle the toughest environments, the PARTAN 3D is adaptable for any lab setting
* The self-cleaning mechanism allows a user to spend less time cleaning the instrument, and more time being productive

**APPLICATION EXAMPLES**

abrasives, aggregates, building materials, extrudates, fertilizers, foods / feeds, geology / mining, glass beads, medicine / pharmaceuticals

**EXCLUSIVE 3D TECHNOLOGY**

* The only particle size analyzer that tracks particles, using 3D particle measurement
* The 3D imaging technology and software are the same for PARTAN 3D and PARTAN 3D MAXI
* All three major particle axes length, width, and thickness are measured
* PARTAN 3D is the only instrument that can provide shape ratios of thickness / width, width / thickness, length / thickness, thickness / length
* All tracked particles are stored in a library and can be recalculated to obtain any size and shape distribution
* The filter function in the SOP offers a customized result calculation and presentation
* The 3D tracking technology enables identification of the minimum-, maximum-, and average- values of size and shape of a single particle automatically

**3D MEASUREMENT SOFTWARE**

* Identify, isolate, and compare parameters of interest for further investigation and analysis
* Permanent set-up of a Standard Operating Procedures is ideal for multiple users, across multiple shifts
* All filters can be reported as individual distributions to provide a more detailed understanding of areas of interest during the analysis
* Allows exclusion of filters from measurement – only report needed information
* Easy to export to other software platforms
* Understand the composition of your material with our classification function. One analysis in less than a minute can provide you with a detailed percentage breakdown of your material. Here is a sample breakdown of a glass bead sample: 45% “good beads” 35% “bad beads” 20% "sand"
* Comprehensive reporting for R&D and methods development
* Users can choose number of channels and channel widths
* Choose from more than 30 morphological parameters in 1 to 6 tabular columns
* Streamlined for at-a-glance QC “pass / fail”
* Image library querying
