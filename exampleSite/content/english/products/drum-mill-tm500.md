description = "The Drum Mill TM 500 is a laboratory ball mill designed to grind large sample volumes up to 35 l. It accepts initial feed sizes of up to 20 mm and can achieve grind sizes down to 15 µm by friction and impact. Hard, brittle or fibrous samples are pulverized in the 150 l drum filled with 80 kg grinding balls. The variable speed of 10 to 50 rpm, different grinding ball sizes and the possibility of long-term grindings of up to 100 h ensure perfect adaption to sample properties as well as reproducible results. A TM 500 foodGrade model featuring a stainless steel 316L drum and hopper is available for applications where the sample must not be contaminated in any way."

## GRINDING OF GRAVEL

40 kg (27 l) sample were filled in the drum of the Drum Mill TM 500, and 80 kg (17.6 l) of 20 mm grinding balls were added. The drum mill was operated for several hours at 50 rpm.  
  
The fineness was measured after 2, 4, 6 and 8 h.  
2h: D90 = 98 µm  
4h: D90 = 37 µm  
6h: D90 = 21 µm  
8h: D90 = 15 µm

**Sample:** Gravel 10-15 mm  
**Feed quantity:** 27 l  
**Grinding balls:** 80 kg, 20 mm diameter

## DRUM MILL TM 500TYPICAL SAMPLE MATERIALS

RETSCH drum mills are true allrounders. They homogenize, for example: activated carbon, alloys, bentonite, bones, carbon fibers, catalysts, cellulose, cement clinker, ceramics, chemical products, clay minerals, coal, coke, compost, concrete, electronic scrap, fibers, gypsum, glass, hair, hydroxyl apatite, kaolin, lime stone, metal oxides, minerals, ores, paint and varnish, paper, pharmaceutical products, pigments, plants, polymers, quartz, seeds, semi-precious stones, sewage sludge, slag, soil, tissue, tobacco, waste, wood, etc.

## GRINDING GENTIAN ROOTS

  
22 l sample were filled in the drum of the Drum Mill TM 500, 80 kg of 30 mm grinding balls were added. The drum mill was operated for several hours at 50 rpm. The fineness was measured after 1 h.  
  
1h: D90 = 130 µm  
  
The optional separation unit to separate the ground sample from the balls was used.  
Used separationd grids: 22 mm for 30 mm grinding ball separation in the upper, middle and lower position.
