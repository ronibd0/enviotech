**Complete quality control of bulk materials**  
  
The CAMSIZER P4 analyzes particle size and shape of dry, free flowing bulk materials in a size range from 20 μm to 30 mm. The software controlled feed chute conveys the sample to the measurement zone, ensuring uniform sample feed and consistent analysis conditions. The particle stream passes an ultra-bright planar LED stroboscopic light source; the resulting shadow projections are captured and evaluated by a camera system.  
  
The particles fall freely during analysis, so the procedure is contact-free and non-destructive. The CAMSIZER P4 provides extremely sharp images and determines a variety of different size and shape parameters for each detected particle. Analysis of hundreds of thousands or even millions of individual particles guarantees results with high statistical reliability. The typical measurement time is only 1 to 3 minutes with 60 images being evaluated per second in real time.

## EXTREMELY WIDE MEASURING RANGE DUE TO UNIQUE DUAL CAMERA TECHNOLOGY

Microtrac MRB’s unique dual camera technology is a landmark in the development of Dynamic Image Analysis. By simultaneously employing two cameras with different magnifications, extremely wide dynamic measuring ranges are archieved. This is accomplished without hardware adjustments or modifications and without compromising accuracy.  
  
Each camera is specialized for one measuring range. The ZOOM camera analyzes fine particles with highest precision whereas the BASIC camera detects the larger particles with great statistical certainity. A special algorithm combines the information provided by both cameras and delivers the exact size distribution in a possible range of more than three decades!  
  
This arrangement resolves a significant drawback of many image analysis systems that employ only one camera, e. g. microscopes. Such instruments either cannot correctly report the fine particles in wide size distributions, or the large particles are not captured due to the small field of view.
