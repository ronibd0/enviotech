* Model: Mixer Mill MM 500 Nano, MM 500 Vario, MM 400, MM 200, Cryomill, Emax, PM 100, PM 100 CM, PM 200, PM 400, PM GRINDCONTROL, XRD-MILL MCCRONE, M 300.
* RETSCH is the world leading manufacturer of laboratory ball mills and offers the perfect product for each application.
* The High Energy Ball Mill Emax and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input. The innovative design of both, the mills and the grinding jars, allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time - with only minor warming effects. These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.
* Mixer Mills grind and homogenize small sample volumes quickly and efficiently by impact and friction. These ball mills are suitable for dry, wet and cryogenic grinding as well as for cell disruption for DNA/RNA recovery.
* Planetary Ball Mills meet and exceed all requirements for fast and reproducible grinding to analytical fineness. They are used for the most demanding tasks in the laboratory, from routine sample processing to colloidal grinding and advanced materials development.
* The drum mill is a type of ball mill suitable for the fine grinding of large feed sizes and large sample volumes.
